Google has put out multiple version of a Google Phone (i.e. Pixel). There are definite pros to using their system. You can cross multiple platforms and keep them all updated. The camera quality of their phones is one of the best. The touch response is very good.
The cons of it is the concerns of tracking information by Google. This is a concern, because if you are using multiple platforms, they can track what you are doing. There is high memory and CPU usage via the system. This can add to slowing down of the phone or Chromebook, etc.
